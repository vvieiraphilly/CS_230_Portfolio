The Gaming Room, which is created by the Creative Technology Solutions, wanted to design a browser version of their mobile game app, Draw It Or Lose It. CTS needed thousands of players in teams, with a server solution. They required that a player could only have one instance of their game in memory at a time, as to not overload the server with multiple games.

The one aspect of this documentation was my recommendation for Linux OS server, as, in my opinion, is the best case scenario for usability and scale for the client. 

Understanding the domain model helped me understand specfically what was needed to build the code, as well as what the client was actually looking for.

If I were to revise anything in this documentation, it would be my comparision between operating systems. 

Listening to the client, I was able to put together this document because I understood exactly what the client "needed," versus what I thought they needed. It is important to understand this, because as the developer, I may understand the background, but not the the aspects of the game that they are already familiar with. 

Moving forward, I would rather have a solid grasp of what everyone else in the industry is doing, and if there was a way to improve upon their framework. Especially if there were bugs that could have been prevented in the beginning.
